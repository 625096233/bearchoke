            <p>I wrote this demo for 2 reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. To write a PoC of the necessary technologies I would need for my next startup and</li>
                <li>2. Because I love Spring and the guides they have on their website. It's the best way to learn how to use frameworks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To those of you who are familiar with the guides on Spring's website or their Sagan reference implementation, this sample is slightly different. The focus is on writing a code base for a real-world scenario:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>More code than just the code required to demo one feature. As coders we need to integrate with many different persistence stores, message queues, frameworks, versions and more.</li>
                <li>More samples showcasing the push towards Single Page Applications (SPAs) while talking to a complex back-end. (<a href="https://twitter.com/ghillert" target="_blank">Gunnar Hillert of Spring</a> has another sample on <a href="https://github.com/ghillert/botanic-ng" target="_blank">Github</a>)</li>
                <li>Different examples on how to persist and query data from different types of DBs</li>
                <li>Showcasing a Spring Security setup with different AuthenticationManagers based on different persistence stores and URL patterns that can act as a good start for any new application.</li>
                <li>Showcasing the beauty of Spring's Java Config support alongside Spring Profiles and the Servlet 3 spec.</li>
                <li>Moving towards truly scalable, event-driven software by leveraging Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) through the awesome Axon Framework and its great Spring support as well as Spring's own support for the WebSocket protocol.</li>
                <li>Finally, because this application is hosted on the fantastic Cloud Foundry PaaS, you can see what's required of your application to easily deploy to CF.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Hope the reader of this gains some insight and has fun with the samples. I will use this as a "dumping ground" for new features I want to try out. Not everything is showcased in the UI. You'll have to go to <a href="https://github.com/bjornharvold/bearchoke" target="_blank">my project on Github</a> and download the source to see how it was all put together.</p>
