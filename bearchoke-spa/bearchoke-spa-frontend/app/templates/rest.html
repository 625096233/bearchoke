        <p>Leverage Restangular, a resource service for AngularJS, with the power of Spring Security, Spring Session and URL versioning</p>

        <p>In this sample you see how to write minimum amount of code to bind server data to AngularJS models. The most interesting part is how to use URL versioning in the Accept header. You can tell the server to fetch different data from the same url.</p>
        <p>Finally, if you are logged in, you can fetch data from a secured service by pre-authenticating with the server. The "secured" button above uses a 'hasRole()' condition to see if the currently logged in user is allowed to make the call; much the same way hasRole() is used by Spring Security in Java land.</p>
